# 🚆 Railway Management System – GUI Project in C#

I'm proud to share a key milestone from my development journey — a **Railway Management System** with a fully functional **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built using **C# and Windows Forms**.
This is my first ever GUI-based project, and it challenged me in all the right ways — teaching me not just technical concepts, but also the value of patience, consistency, and pushing beyond my limits.

## 🧠 My Journey Behind the Project

This project is more than just a coding assignment — it’s a story of commitment, passion, and persistence.
I set a personal challenge to complete this project in **just 3 days**. Despite being completely new to GUI development, I pushed myself — working **day and night**, sometimes up to **13 hours straight till 4 AM** — to build something real, functional, and professional.
It wasn’t easy, but I gave it my all. And when it finally came together, it felt amazing.
> **“This is just the beginning. InshaAllah, many more projects are on the way.”**
